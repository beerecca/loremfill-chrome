## WeTransfer Fill

A Google Chrome extension to fill random test data into web forms. The extension attempts to fill context specific data for each field. If no decision can be made, the extension fills a random sentence as the value of the field.

### How to use

First download this repo (either clone or download the zip file). Navigate in Chrome to `chrome://extensions` and click on `Developer Mode` in the top right. Click `Load Unpacked` and select the folder.

When you are ready to fill in a form, click the pencil icon or press `Command + Shift + 1`. If you right click the icon and go to the `Options` you can enter in your email address and a password that will be used when filling in forms.
